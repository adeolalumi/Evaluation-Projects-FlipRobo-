The analysis reveals significant insights into avocado pricing and market dynamics. Organic avocados command higher prices, indicating consumer
preferences and pricing strategies. Regional price variations, notably in areas like Hartford-Springfield, New York, and San Francisco, reflect 
differences in income levels and demand for organic produce. Data distribution analysis highlights right-skewed distributions in avocado volume and 
bag-related metrics, indicating occasional outliers. Avocado prices exhibit a moderately right-skewed distribution, with both lower-priced and 
higher-priced avocados present. Negative correlations between avocado prices and volume suggest price decreases with higher supply, while a weak 
positive correlation with time hints at a slight price increase over the years. 

Model evaluation favours RandomForestRegressor and XGBRegressor, with XGBoost selected for its robust performance. K-fold cross-validation ensures 
the reliability of the chosen model for future predictions and study. Overall, the analysis provides comprehensive insights into avocado pricing, 
regional variations, and predictive modelling, contributing to a deeper understanding of the avocado market.
